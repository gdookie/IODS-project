Open Data Science - first impressions
===
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## The way of learning
I like the way we are learning data science in the course

* Excellent combinations of learning spaces and materials on the net
    + 24/7 availability
    + text, graphs, videos
    + Moodle Rooms MOOC
    + Datacamp
    + GitHub
    
* Open and relaxed athmosphere in the classes

## The subjects we are learning
I'm very exited about all the subjects we are learning. Many of my current interests are included.

* Programming
* Statistics
* Latest web technologies
* Social sciences

<!--This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. -->
