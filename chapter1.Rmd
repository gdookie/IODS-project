# Hello All Open Data Science People!
## This course is awesome!
I'm really exited about this course. Here's a couple of reasons why.

* Open data science is a combination of superduper interesting things
    + statistics
    + programming
    + datamining
    + open source
* The course lecturer and assistants are super helpful and cool
* The course is constantly evolving



```
R code goes here!
```

> *"Life is a continuous learning path."*
